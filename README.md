substitution app for childhood 'conlang'
I had an old substitution "conlang" for a fantasy nation I wrote about as a child.  I adapted a very old translate webpage without understanding JS fully.  This is that application made more modern as a learning tool for basic JS. 

It was made up of swapping the letters width-wise on a keyboard, except for the vowels.  Example: q = p, z = m, t = t (because it's in the middle of its row)

When there's combinations such as bt, lh, etc. add a vowel after the
first consonant according to this chart.  If the combanation is pro-
nouncable, then adding another vowel isn't necessary, but it'll
still have a tendency to sound like its "vowel added" combination.

A:  C, J, L, V
E:  B, F, P, Z
I:  F, H, R, X
O:  G, M, T, W
U:  K, N, S, Q
